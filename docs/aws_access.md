# AWS S3 access

You do not need AWS credentials to download public files. 

To download private files or to upload files to S3, you will need an admin to create a user for you.
After you have received your credentials, you can configure your access in two ways:

## Option 1: configuration via command line
Use `awscli` to configure your AWS access.
```shell
pip install awscli
aws configure
```
(use region `us-east-1`, output-format `json`)

## Option 2: configuration via file
You can also create the configuration files yourself.

Create your credentials file at `~/.aws/credentials`:
```
[default]
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

To configure region and output format, create a config file at `~/.aws/config`:
```
[default]
region = us-east-1
output-format = json
```
