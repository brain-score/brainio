# BrainIO Glossary

#### BrainIO Catalog
* a list of lookup information for finding [Stimulus Sets](#stimulus-set) And [Data Assemblies](#data-assembly), as defined by the [BrainIO Format Specification](SPECIFICATION.md)

#### Data
* information, usually the numeric result of physical measurements performed in the context of an experiment, stored digitally

#### Data Assembly
* a format defined by the [BrainIO Format Specification](SPECIFICATION.md) for representing and exchanging data collected during neuroscience experiments

#### Metadata
* information that describes other information

#### netCDF
* a format for storing and exchanging self-describing data;  see [netCDF's documentation](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/)

#### Neuroid
* a general term used in [BrainIO](../README.md) for neurons and neuron-analogs, including groups of neurons and software elements inspired by neurons

#### numpy
* a [Python](https://www.python.org/) library for efficiently working with numeric data;  see [numpy's documentation](https://numpy.org/)

#### pandas
* a [Python](https://www.python.org/) library for working with named and indexed one-dimensional data objects (called a [Series](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/dsintro.html#series)) and collections of those objects (called a [DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/dsintro.html#dataframe));  see [pandas' documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

#### Pull Request
* a mechanism offered by cloud [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) providers like [GitHub](https://github.com/) by which users can offer code to other users or organizations;  see [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests)

#### Repository
* a set of files and directories managed by a [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) such as [Git](https://git-scm.com/);  cloud services such as [GitHub](https://github.com/) [host copies of repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories) to make them easier to share

#### Stimulus Set
* a format defined by the [BrainIO Format Specification](SPECIFICATION.md) for representing and exchanging experimental stimuli and associated metadata

#### xarray
* a [Python](https://www.python.org/) library for working with self-describing data, based on [netCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/);  see [xarray's documentation](https://xarray.pydata.org/)
